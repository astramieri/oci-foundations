# Security Introduction

In an on-premises environment, you own the whole stack and you are responsible for security end-to-end. In a **shared security model** some of the responsibilities transfer to the Cloud provider.

## Security Services

Security is not just one service or an add-on. 

Security is enforced at different layers of the stack:
- instracture protection
- identity and access management
- OS and workload protection
- data protection
- detection and remediation
