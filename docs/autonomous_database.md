# Autonomous Database

Autonomous Database is a cloud database that uses machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks, traditionally performed by DBAs.

So the idea is, as much as you can automate and let your users focus on differentiated higher level tasks, the better it is because they don't have to get involved with a lot of manual tasks and repetitive tasks. They don't have to do these because some of these tasks are also *error prone*. So using technologies like machine learning, we can take that out from the equation, let them focus on the value, additive, higher level differentiated tasks.

Autonomous Database supports two database/workload types:
1. **Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP)**: this is for your OLTP,  so think about transactions. 
2. **Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)**: this is for online analytical processing.
